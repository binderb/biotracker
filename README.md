<!-- ## Usage -->

<!-- ### Installation -->

<!-- This app requires Node.js, as well as a running instance of MySQL. To deploy, pull down the repo and provide login credentials for an authorized MySQL user in a `.env` file. Then, start the server with `npm run start`. -->

<!-- ### Customization -->

<!-- You must provide a value for `WEB_TITLE` in your `.env` file to properly set the navbar branding and page titles; choose a concise string appropriate for your organization. You must also add a `logo.png` file and `favicon.ico` file to the `/public/images/` directory. Optionally, you may also change the primary UI color by providing hexadecimal strings (e.g. `"#0099FF"`) for the `BRANDING_PRIMARY` and `BRANDING_PRIMARY_HIGHLIGHT` values in your `.env` file. -->
